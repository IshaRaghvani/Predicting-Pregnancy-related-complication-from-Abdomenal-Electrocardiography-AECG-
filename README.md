# AECG-Based Prediction of Pregnancy Complications with Enhanced Scoring and Clustered Data Augmentation

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to accurately categorize fetal health and predict the risk of preterm delivery using machine learning techniques. This approach aims to provide valuable insights for medical professionals, improving decision-making and potentially reducing the incidence of preterm births.

## Overview
This project leverages **Abdominal Electrocardiography (AECG)** to predict pregnancy-related complications, a vital area of maternal health. AECG signals, recorded from the abdominal region, provide crucial information on both fetal and maternal heart activity. By analyzing these signals, the goal is to develop a predictive model capable of identifying potential risks and complications during pregnancy.

## Key Innovations
### 1. **Novel Scoring Function**
A significant innovation in this research is the introduction of a **novel scoring function** that enhances the predictive accuracy of AECG-based models. This scoring function quantifies the severity of patterns observed within the AECG signals, enabling a more precise identification of high-risk pregnancies and improving early detection.

### 2. **Cluster-Based Data Augmentation**
To further optimize the model's performance, a **cluster-based data augmentation algorithm** is implemented. This technique generates synthetic samples by clustering similar data points, effectively increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset. By expanding the dataset, this approach helps improve the model's ability to generalize and predict pregnancy-related complications more accurately, even in cases with limited or imbalanced data.

## Impact
By combining these advancements—enhanced predictive modeling with a novel scoring function and innovative data augmentation techniques—this project aims to improve the accuracy of pregnancy-related complication predictions. Ultimately, this work contributes to better maternal and fetal health outcomes, supporting medical professionals in making informed, timely decisions to reduce risks associated with pregnancy.
