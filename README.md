#AECG-Based Prediction of Pregnancy Complications with Enhanced Scoring and Clustered Data Augmentation
The objective is to precisely categorize fetal health and forecast the risk of preterm delivery by utilizing machine learning techniques. This will give medical personnel useful information to improve decision-making and maybe lower the rate of preterm births. 


This project focuses on leveraging Abdominal Electrocardiography (AECG) to predict pregnancy-related complications, a crucial area of maternal health. AECG signals, which are recorded from the abdominal region, offer valuable insights into fetal and maternal heart activity. By analyzing these signals, the project aims to develop a predictive model that can identify potential risks and complications during pregnancy. 

A key innovation in this research is the introduction of a novel scoring function designed to enhance the predictive accuracy of AECG-based models. This scoring function quantifies the severity of patterns within the AECG signals, facilitating better identification of high-risk pregnancies.

To further improve model performance, a cluster-based data augmentation algorithm is employed. This technique creates synthetic samples by clustering similar data points, effectively expanding the training dataset and enhancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen cases. 

Together, these advancements contribute to more robust and accurate predictions of pregnancy-related complications, ultimately supporting better maternal and fetal health outcomes.
